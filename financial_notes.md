<span id="1" style="color:pink">Hudge fund strategies:</span>

1. Equity Long short
>Long/Short – In this strategy, hedge fund managers can either purchase stocks that they feel are undervalued or sell short stocks they deem to be overvalued. In most cases, the fund will have positive exposure to the equity markets – for example, having 70% of the funds invested long in stocks and 30% invested in the shorting of stocks. In this example, the net exposure to the equity markets is 40% (70%-30%) and the fund would not be using any leverage (Their gross exposure would be 100%). If the manager, however, increases the long positions in the fund to, say, 80% while still maintaining a 30% short position, the fund would have gross exposure of 110% (80%+30% = 110%), which indicates leverage of 10%.

2. Market Neutral
>Market Neutral – In this strategy, a hedge fund manager applies the same basic concepts mentioned in the previous paragraph, but seeks to minimize the exposure to the broad market. This can be done in two ways. If there are equal amounts of investment in both long and short positions, the net exposure of the fund would be zero. For example, if 50% of funds were invested long and 50% were invested short, the net exposure would be 0% and the gross exposure would be 100%. (Find out how this strategy works with mutual funds; read Getting Positive Results With Market-Neutral Funds.)
There is a second way to achieve market neutrality, and that is to have zero beta exposure. In this case, the fund manager would seek to make investments in both long and short positions so that the beta measure of the overall fund is as low as possible. In either of the market-neutral strategies, the fund manager's intention is to remove any impact of market movements and rely solely on his or her ability to pick stocks.

3. Macroeconomic
>Generally speaking, these are the strategies that have the highest risk/return profiles of any hedge fund strategy. Global macro funds invest in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, options, futures, forwards and other forms of derivative securities. They tend to place directional bets on the prices of underlying assets and they are usually highly leveraged. Most of these funds have a global perspective and, because of the diversity of investments and the size of the markets in which they invest, they can grow to be quite large before being challenged by capacity issues. Many of the largest hedge fund "blow-ups" were global macros, including Long-Term Capital Management and Amaranth Advisors. Both were fairly large funds and both were highly leveraged. (For more, read Massive Hedge Fund Failures and Losing The Amaranth Gamble.)

4. Market Inefficiency
5. Event-Driven

<span id="2" style="color:pink">Inverstment Broker</span>  
> Main function:    
- An intermediary between seller and buyer  
- To make transactions on behalf of and paid by the client   or on his behalf and at the expense of the client  
- To inform and consult the client, especially about risks  
- To insure client's operations     
- Infrastructural support of operations with securities


<span id='3' style="color:pink">Passive management</Span>
> Passive management is an investing strategy that tracks a market-weighted index or portfolio. The most popular method is to mimic the performance of an externally specified index by buying an index fund. E.g.(S$P500)

<span id='4' style="color:pink">enhanced momentum investing model</span>
> maybe treat it as momentum strategy   
> Momentum investing is a system of buying stocks or other securities that have had high returns(positive momentum) over the past three to twelve months, and selling those that have had poor returns(negative momentum) over the same period.   
> The main hypotheses for this strategy(Why this strategy works):
> 动量策略的投资风险很高，提供的超额投资回报并不稳定。 用动量策略架构的投资组合带有更高的波动性。动量策略需要比较高的交易频率，因为交易费用和摩擦损失（Bid-ask spread）会比较高。（适合流动性好的大型资本市场）
>
> Its hard to explain this phenomenon in term of an efficient-market hypotheses.
>
> (About enhance return) In the case of the Durham study, the analyzed segments
were referred to as “buckets” of bonds with different
duration, and the strategy used the trends of total return
indices for these fixed-income buckets to determine
momentum and position accordingly, resulting in
enhanced returns, without significantly increasing risk.

<span id='5' style="color:pink">ETFs</span>
> Difference between Hedge fund, Mutual Funds and ETFs.
>   
> Hedge fund uses investment and risk management strategies to generate return. (aggressive, high return and high risk). Less regulated as compared to mutual funds and ETFs. Hedge funds are very much illiquid. 流动性一般不足，需要投资者锁定投资一年以上。    
>
> Mutual Funds: is a pool of funds collected from investors to invest in financial instruments. These funds are controlled and managed by a fund manager on behalf of the investors. The fund manager decides which stock or bond to buy and how much. A mutual fund distributes the entire investment amount into small units which are purchased by investors instead of directly investing in stocks and shares themselves.
>
> ETFs: An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a marketable security that tracks a commodity, bond or an index or a basket of assets. ETFs are listed and traded on a securities exchange. When an investor invests in ETFs, the money is invested in a bunch of market securities which are a part of a pre-determined index. The investment is made in the same proportion of the index.
(like selling Structural product, 即卖已经确定好的投资组合，包含期货债券指数等一系列资产)


<span id='6' style="color:pink">Behavioral econnomics</span>    
>(Its relevant to explain the momentum effect in effect-market hypothesis)   
>
>Behavioral Economics is the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions. The two most important questions in this field are:

>1. Are economists' assumptions of utility or profit maximization good approximations of real people's behavior?

>2. Do individuals maximize subjective expected utility?

<span id='7' style="color:pink">Market anomaly</span>
> A market anomaly (or market inefficiency) in a financial market is a price and/or rate of return distortion that seems to contradict the efficient-market hypothesis.
>
>The market anomaly usually relates to:
>
>- Structural factors, such as unfair competition, lack of market transparency, regulatory actions, etc.
>- Behavioral biases by economic agents (see behavioral economics)
>- Calendar effects, such as the January effect.
There are anomalies in relation to the economic fundamentals of the equity, technical trading rules, and economic calendar events.
>
>Anomalies could be fundamental, technical, or calendar related.    
> Fundamental anomalies include value effect, small-cap effect (low P/E stocks and small cap companies do better than index on an average) and the low-volatility anomaly.
>
> Calendar anomalies involve patterns in stock returns from year to year or month to month.   
>
> while technical anomalies include momentum effect.

<span id='8' style='color:pink'>Efficient-market hypothesis</span>
>
> The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a theory in financial economics that states that asset prices fully reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.
>
> There are three variants of the hypothesis: "weak", "semi-strong", and "strong" form. The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or property) already reflect all past publicly available information. The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even hidden "insider" information.

<span id='9' style='color:pink'> Market Distortion</span>
>Market distortion is an economic scenario that occurs when there is an intervention(介入) in a given market by a governing body. The intervention may take the form of price ceilings(价格上限), price floors(价格下限) or tax subsidies(税收补贴).
>
> Government actions aren't solely responsible for all market distortions. Several types of events, actions, policies or beliefs can bring about a market distortion.
>
> Other Possible Causes of Market Distortions:
- Criminal coercion or subversion of legal contracts,
- Lack of liquidity in the market (lack of buyers, - sellers, product, or money),
- Collusion among market participants,
- Mass non-rational behavior by market participants,
- Price supports or subsidies,
- Stifling or corrupt government regulation.
- Nonconvex consumer preference sets
- Market externalities
- Natural factors that impede competition between firms, such as occurs in land markets

<span id='10' style="color:pink">Asset Pricing model</span>
> In financial economics, asset pricing refers to a formal treatment and development of two main pricing principles.
>
> The first principle: general equilibrium asset pricing where prices are determined through market pricing by supply and demand. Here, any equilibrium asset pricing model is one in which the asset prices jointly satisfy the requirement that the quantities of each asset supplied and the quantities demanded must be equal at that price. The models here are born out of modern portfolio theory, with the Capital Asset Pricing Model as the prototypical result.
>
> The second: rational pricing where (usually) derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to more fundamental (equilibrium determined) securities prices; The classical model here is Black–Scholes which describes the dynamics of a market including derivatives (with its option pricing formula);
>
> an important difference is that these use different probabilities: respectively, the real-world (or actuarial) probability, denoted by "P", and the risk-neutral (or arbitrage-pricing) probability, denoted by "Q".

> 根据不同的假设 延伸出了两种不同的模型     
> Equilibrium pricing 和 Risk neutral Pricing  
> 典型的两种风格。P宗(真实概率测度)和Q宗(风险中度测度)   
> Q宗：风险中性的意思主要是说历史数据不能帮助你预测未来的走势，所以你的决策是没有风险补偿的。(主要还是在风险跟定价上)  
> P宗：P是指真实概率测度。所谓真实，主要是说模型依赖的概率分布是从历史数据上估算出来的。  
> 这个区别也造成在业界的划分。Q可以让你在缺少数据的情况得出一些结论，从而可以凭空制造一些东西出来，所以卖方（投行）用来做衍生品定价，业务模式是开发新的衍生品出来卖出去。P则喜欢大数据量，这天然就是买方（Hedge Fund类）所需要的技术，因为他们本来就需要针对大量证券做出筛选和投资决策，业务是数据驱动的。

<span id='11' style="color:pink">Equilibrium pricing model</span>   
CAPM(Capital asset pricing model)
>CAPM is a model used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset, to make decisions about adding assets to a well-diversified portfolio. (CAPM is based on the Efficient-market hypothesis)   

>现实中的市场越有效，信息越公开，投资者不理性，标准的CAPM模型就越适用，就比较倾向于传统的Q quant.
>相反，现实中市场越无效，信息越不公开，可以说明超额收益的存在。数据挖掘的p quant的功能就越强大。

Black Scholes model


<span id='13' style='color:pink'>Financial Product Introduction</span>
> Security = Bond + Stock + other security    
> Derivative = Contract + Futures + Options

> Fixed income refers to any type of investment under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule.   
> 大多数都是国家或者企业发放债券bond, 然后需要支付固定的金融。 而且fixed income是强制性支付的。

> commodities
> In economics, the term commodity is used specifically for economic goods or services that have full or partial but substantial fungibility; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.    
> The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets.

<span id='14' style='color:pink'>Systematic strategy</span>
> two basic systematic strategy   
> Mean-reverting and momentum strategies    

> Mean-reverting suggests that a stock’s price eventually returns to its mean or average price after a temporary deviation. (“buy low, sell high”)

> Momentum strategy is total opposite. momentum strategies are devised on the premise that strong moves in the market in either direction will be most likely followed by higher highs and lower lows. Trend following strategies try to capitalize on big market movements by buying stocks that are showing an upward trend and selling stocks that are on a downward trend.  

> Trading strategies can be profitable only if securities prices are either mean-reverting or trending (momentum). Otherwise, they are random walking, and trading will be futile.
>
> When the prices are trending, they are also said
to have “momentum,” and thus the corresponding trading strategy is often called a momentum strategy.


Pair Trading
> Pairs trading is a non-directional, relative value investment strategy that seeks to identify 2 companies or funds with similar characteristics whose equity securities are currently trading at a price relationship that is out of their historical trading range. This investment strategy will entail buying the undervalued security while short-selling the overvalued security, all while maintaining market neutrality. It can also be referred to as market neutral or statistical arbitrage.
>
> One of the main keys to pairs trading is finding strong correlations between financial instruments, thus building a foundation for further analysis.
>
> Pairs work is based on a correlation between 2 (or more) stocks, sectors, indexes, or other financial instruments.
>
> Mean reversion: In finance, mean reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move to the average price over time.
