  - Structured Prediction
   >Given given some input structure x∈X, such as a token, sentence, or document ...
predict an output structure y∈Y, such as a class label, a sentence or syntactic tree
  - Preprocessing
  >Tokenization: Identify the words in a string of characters.
Improve input representation in structured prediction recipe.
  >
  >Sentence Segmentation:
Many NLP tools work sentence-by-sentence.
Often trivial after tokenisation: split sentences at sentence-ending punctuation tokens.
