#### Bloomberg
##### <span style='color:pink'>Machine Learning Data Analyst</span>  
My name is Shuhao Zhang. I am a recent graduate from UCL machine learning. During my academic study, I have learned Bayesian statistics machine learning such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Also, I have experience in deep learning which is taught by Google DeepMind. Based on these fundamental knowledge, I also have experience in natural language process and data mining. In detail, I have hands-on experience in word-to-vector, language modelm and structured prediction. For example, one of my project is to match the news title and news content.

Prior to my MSc, I have gained first class degree in University of Liverpool. The undergraduate study equips me with experience in computer data structure, algorithm solving, database management. I have created a traffic control system simulation in Java with people in one group.

For now, I think python is my most widely used programming language and I also familiar with popular machine learning package such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow.

Why are you interested in this job?
>First, I think my interest and skillset fit this role. I can do some things for the company as a machine learning data analyst. Second, I see the value of the company. I believe data become more and more important right now and Bloomberg is a data provider for financial market. I can see large potential development for the company. Last, I have been to Bloomberg London office, I love the work environment.  

Why are you fit this role?
>I have checked the requirement of this role.
First, I think this role fits my interest, I am glad to have opportunity to apply machine learning into real-world problem. Second, I am proficient in python and I keep practicing my programming skills in the Leetcode. Third, I have experience in software development in a small group.   

Question:
1. What's role of machine learning data analyst? I see its belong to fund & portfolios team. My main role is to apply an end-to-end implementation to extract fund information with NLP. Will I involve in other projects (maybe relevant with NLP but not fund & portfolios) in the future?
