The deep learning is black-box method, sometimes we are not quite sure how to tuning the parameter for the neural network. since we may have several parameter, we have to use brute force to test every combination of parameter and write down the model performance in the excel. Also, another method, is to ask some experienced people for help because the parameter tuning in deep learning seems like a empirical work.

To be honest, I learned a lot from these interview opportunity. To solve these potential problems, now before I apply a role of a company, I hope to do as much as research to learn about the department, the role, how relevant of my skillset. For interview, I try to write down the answer for all the behaviour question and experience. For the code test, I try to practice my programming skill in Leetcode every day.
